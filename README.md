## Description
The Game Search App is a simple JavaFX application that allows users to search for games by entering the game's name in the search input box. The application uses a RESTful API to fetch game data based on the user's input and displays the search results in a list. Users can then select a game from the list to view its details, including the game's name, genre, release date, rating, URL, and summary.
